D3 Visualisation of London's COVID-19 lockdowns

Chart displays London's COVID-19 daily new cases and daily deaths data using the UK government API at <https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk>.

An approximation of current lockdown conditions is presented in various shades of red. This is determined by the author based on the lockdown restrictions in force in London at the time. It is not to be confused with the UK Government's COVID-19 alert level system.

Significant events related to the pandemic response (especially regarding transport) are displayed, containing a description and source information for each event.
Many events found using [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom_(Januaryâ€“June_2020)) and [Transport for London press releases](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases).
